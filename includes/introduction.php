        <p>Hi, I am Huy Xuon Lieu, and I am going to be a web developer</p>
        <p>
          I have taught myself programming for a while, and I decided to focus
          on web development several moths ago. This is a challenging career
          because it requires a lot of skills rather than just coding. I enjoy
          every part of website development from design, taking photos to coding
          and maintaining the website. I also love writing web's content, but my
          writing skills need to be enhanced a lot to be good enough to provide
          text content for a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I usually read design and programming posts on dev.to or watch YouTube
          videos. I spend most of my free time with my wife and reading books. I
          also do exercises several times a year.
